# What Is Amazon MQ?<a name="welcome"></a>

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud\. A *message broker* allows software applications and components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal messaging protocols\.

Amazon MQ works with your existing applications and services without the need to manage, operate, or maintain your own messaging system\.

## What Are the Main Benefits of Amazon MQ?<a name="main-benefits"></a>

+ **Accelerated migration** – Amazon MQ supports industry\-standard APIs and protocols so you can migrate from your existing message broker without rewriting application code\.

+ **Reduced cost** – Amazon MQ provides cost\-efficient and flexible messaging capacity—you pay for broker instance and storage usage as you go\.

+ **Operation offloading** – Amazon MQ manages the administration and maintenance of ActiveMQ brokers and automatically provisions infrastructure for high availability\.

## How Is Amazon MQ Different from Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS?<a name="difference-from-sqs-sns"></a>

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that provides compatibility with many popular message brokers\. We recommend Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers that rely on compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP\.

[Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) are queue and topic services that are highly scalable, simple to use, and don't require you to set up message brokers\. We recommend these services for new applications that can benefit from nearly unlimited scalability and simple APIs\.
