# Ensuring Effective Amazon MQ Performance<a name="ensuring-effective-amazon-mq-performance"></a>

The following design patterns can improve the effectiveness and performance of your Amazon MQ broker\.

## Disable Concurrent Store and Dispatch for Queues with Slow Consumers<a name="disable-concurrent-store-and-dispatch-queues-flag-slow-consumers"></a>

By default, Amazon MQ optimizes for queues with fast consumers:

+ Consumers are considered to be *fast* if they are able to keep up with the rate of messages generated by producers\.

+ Consumers are considered to be *slow* if a queue builds a backlog of unacknowledged messages, potentially causing a decrease in producer throughput\.

To instruct Amazon MQ to optimize for queues with slow consumers, set the `concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues` attribute to `false`\. For an example configuration, see [`concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues`](child-element-details.md#concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues)\.
